            <p>The ADA Refactor is an item that can flip the alignment of a portal from one Enlightened to Resistance.
                Itâ€™s a very powerful weapon and so far there is no protection against it. It can be used by either faction.
                If you are with the Enlightened and need to drop a link or to make a higher level portal due to lack of agents,
                you can use the ADA Refactor to flip it.  After flipping, ADA will be owner of that portal. If you are resistance,
                portal, resonators and mods will be under your ownership. Possible uses include: breaking unwanted links,
                AP Gain  (flipping a portal gives zero AP but what you can do with it after can give AP), and creating a Level 8
                portal using less than 8 players.</p>

            <p>There is an hour wait on flipping a portal after it has been flipped (even if leveled rebuilt and flipped again)
                any additional virus used on the portal will simply be used without affecting the alignment of the portal.  So during
                anomalies and events this could be used to a strategic end. You cannot flip a portal which is more than 1 level above
                you and you need a full xm bar to do so.</p>
