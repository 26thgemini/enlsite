                The Force Amplifier is used to increase the Force of portal defense. Its one of the 5 new Portal Mods from
                Ingress v1.28. This is a good defensive mod, and combined with the Portal Shields and the Turret mods can
                make it a hell of a hard time for someone who attacks your portal!
            </p>

            <p>
                With every deployed Force Amplifier you get less and less benefit from them, so keep that in mind so you
                will be more efficient in your use of amplifiers. This is a way to discourage the deployment of the same
                mods on portal and to keep portals from being too powerful.

                <ul>
                    <li>First one = +1x damage</li>
                    <li>Second one = +0.25x damage</li>
                    <li>Third one = +0.125x damage</li>
                    <li>Forth one = +0.125x damage</li>
                </ul>
            
            <p>
                With only one Rare Force amplifier you get 2x damage and with 4 Force amplifiers you only get 3x
                damage! So donâ€™t put more than one Force Amplifier on a Portal!
