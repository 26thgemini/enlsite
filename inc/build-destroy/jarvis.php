                The Jarvis Virus  is an item that can flip the alignment of a portal from one Resistance to Enlightened.
                Itâ€™s a very powerful weapon and so far there is no protection against it. It can be used by either faction.
                If you are with the Resistance and need to drop a link or to make a higher level portal due to lack of
                agents, you can use the Jarvis Virus to flip it.  After flipping, Jarvis will be owner of that portal.
                If you are enlightened, portal, resonators and mods will be under your ownership. Possible uses include:
                breaking unwanted links, AP Gain (flipping a portal gives zero AP but what you can do with it after can
                give AP), and creating a Level 8 portal using less than 8 players.
            </p>
            <p>
                here is an hour wait on flipping a portal after it has been flipped (even if leveled rebuilt and flipped
                again) any additional virus used on the portal will simply be used without affecting the alignment of
                the portal.  So during anomalies and events this could be used to a strategic end. You cannot flip a portal
                which is more than 1 level above you and you need a full xm bar to do so.
