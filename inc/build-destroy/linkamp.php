                The Link amplifier is used to increase the Portal Link Range of a Portal, and itâ€™s one of the new mods
                from Ingress v 1.28.1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each deployed Link Amplifier will increase the linking range of a Portal. We only have the Rare type
                for now and we will update values as soon as we get the info:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rare = +2x Link range</li>
                <li>Very Rare = +7x Link range</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With every deployed Link Amplifier you get less and less benefit from them.  This is a way to discourage
                the deployment of the same mods on a portal.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First = x1 range</li>
                <li>Second = x0.25 range</li>
                <li>Third = x0.125 range</li>
                <li>Forth = x0.125 range</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                So you can see with only one Rare Link amplifier you get 2x range and with 4 Rare Link amplifiers you  get 3x range!
                So now maximum portal range is 655.36 km * 10.5 = 6881.28 km
