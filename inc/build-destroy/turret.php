                Turrets are used to increase the rate of portal attacks. Turrets are the  most rumored and long awaited
                Portal Mod. They are making attacking some farms very hard. Itâ€™s a great combo with the new Force Amplifier mod.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each deployed Turret increases the attack frequency and hit bonus of Portal. We only have the Rare type for
                now and we will update values as soon as we get the info:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rare = +2x Attack Frequency +0.2 Hit Bonus</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With every deployed Turret you get less and less benefit from them, so keep that in mind so you will be
                more efficient in your use of turrets. This is a way to discourage the deployment of the same mods on portal
                and to keep portals from being too powerful.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>First one = +2x </li>
                <li>Second one = +0.25x</li>
                <li>Third one = +0.125x</li>
                <li>Forth one = +0.125x</li>
            </ul>
            <p>So the maximum increase in attack frequency is 3x and 0.8 hit bonus.</p>
