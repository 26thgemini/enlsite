                Ultra strikes are a new type of weapon released with the moto-droid phone line put out by motorola.
                Unlike the normal bursters which disperse in a wide range arcing further out (dependant upon level),
                These bursters are concentrated to a tiny area. (you have to be standing on the resonator or the portal
                or you will miss)
            </p>
            <p>
                These new bursters which are publicly hackable now (originally only available to be hacked by agents with
                the droid-x phones)  are useful for knocking mods off of portals without hitting the resonators or for
                taking out single resonators at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like itâ€™s xmp brother, ultrastrikes come in levels 1-8 and have hack similarly to power cubes, where it
                will release a ultrastrike that matches the level of the portal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ultrastrikes have a similar breakdown when it comes to recycling them for xm, as regular bursters do.
                Which gives you 20x the level of the ultrastrike in xm.
