                XMP Bursters are one of the offensive Ingress items, along with Ultra Strikes, the ADA Refactor, and Jarvis
                Virus.  With them you can destroy resonators, portals, links and control fields. XMP Bursters are leveled
                from 1 to 8, and each one has a different damage and range. You can only use XMPâ€™s that are lower or equal
                to your level. Bursters actually only damage Portal Resonators and Mods, but if you destroy 5 out of 8
                resonators on one portal, you will destroy all links and control fields that are connected to it. XMPs produce
                a blast of XM energy in all directions in a radius dependent on the burster level.

                With Update 1.32.1, firing bursters has become even easier. Agents still have 2 options for the initial
                burster though. If you want to start with the highest level burster first, just use the original swype
                method. Then if you want to change the level after that, use the mini carousel that appears. If you want
                to start with a lower level burster, use the OPS menu to fire. Either way the mini carousel appears allowing
                you to change levels without going back through the OPS screen.

                Every level of XMP has different damage and range. Damage is done to the XM energy levels on deployed
                resonators. XMPs only damage enemy resonators that are in range of the XMP attack. Damage is shown in
                the percentage that is lost, in red above each resonator.
